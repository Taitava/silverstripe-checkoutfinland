Checkout Finland payment module for SilverStripe framework/CMS.

2016-11-17: Oh, I just noticed that I've created this repo a year ago, but didn't put any content to it :O. Well, I think I will do that the next time I will continue working on this module. Until then, please send me a message in GitHub if you are looking for a Checkout Finland module for SilverStripe.

Checkout Finland provides payment buttons to web stores etc. Most of it's clients are in Finland. This module uses their API and is not designed for any other service, so if you are not familiar with the company or do not work on a project (or for a customer) that has a contract with Checkout Finland, then I guess you are looking for a different module :).

2017-11-17: Just noticed that I have written the above message exactly one year ago :o.
